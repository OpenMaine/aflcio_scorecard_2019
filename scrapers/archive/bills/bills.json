        "short_description": "Firefighters, dispatchers, bus drivers and teachers testified in strong support of LD 1177, which would have leveled the playing field for public sector workers in contract negotiations. Currently, if workers and management can\u2019t reach a contract, there is a process of mediation, fact-finding and then arbitration. But arbitration is not binding on wages, insurance and retirement. This stacks the table against working people and makes it harder to improve staffing and the services we all rely on. LD 1177 would have fixed the power imbalance by making arbitration binding on wages, insurance and retirement. Unfortunately, Governor Janet Mills vetoed this priority bill.",
