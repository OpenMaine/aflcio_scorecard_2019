President Troy Jackson (D-Aroostook)


# OFFICIAL TITLE
“An Act To Improve Public Sector Labor Relations”


# FINAL OUTCOME
Defeated (Passed by the Legislature, Vetoed by the Governor)


# SHORT DESCRIPTION
Firefighters, dispatchers, bus drivers and teachers testified in strong support of LD 1177, which would have leveled the playing field for public sector workers in contract negotiations. Currently, if workers and management can’t reach a contract, there is a process of mediation, fact-finding and then arbitration. But arbitration is not binding on wages, insurance and retirement. This stacks the table against working people and makes it harder to improve staffing and the services we all rely on. LD 1177 would have fixed the power imbalance by making arbitration binding on wages, insurance and retirement. Unfortunately, Governor Janet Mills vetoed this priority bill.

# OFFICIAL TITLE
“An Act To Clarify Prevailing Wage Rates on State Projects Using Federal Funds”


# FINAL OUTCOME
Enacted into law (Passed by the Legislature, Signed by the Governor)


# SHORT DESCRIPTION
Prevailing wage laws ensure a basic wage standard on publicly funded construction projects. These laws ensure that state, municipal and federal governments, as major purchasers of construction services, do not depress wages. LD 1658 will close a loophole that has allowed public school construction to escape prevailing wage requirements. Under LD 1658, municipal projects receiving $50,000 or more in state funds must pay the prevailing wage.

# OFFICIAL TITLE
“An Act to Expand Application of the Maine Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Act of 1973 to Harvesters and Haulers of Forest Products”


# FINAL OUTCOME
Enacted into law (Passed by the Legislature, Signed by the Governor)


# SHORT DESCRIPTION
For decades, loggers and wood haulers have been at the mercy of powerful timber companies that force them to work extremely long hours, often for low pay and no benefits. As so-called “independent contractors,” loggers have been prohibited under anti-trust laws from banding together to bargain collectively. LD 1459 will allow loggers to form cooperatives and demand better wages and working conditions. The loggers and haulers who led this effort are organizing the New England Loggers Cooperative with the Machinists Union.

# FINAL OUTCOME
Enacted into law (Passed by the Legislature, Signed by the Governor)


# SHORT DESCRIPTION
Climate change poses an existential threat to all that we care about.

Ironworkers 7, IBEW 1253 & 567, the Maine Building Trades and the Maine AFL-CIO testified in support of LD 1282. The bill will create good paying jobs and a well-trained green energy workforce by requiring the use of registered apprenticeship programs on large scale energy projects.

Right to Work for Less

Opposed


# SPONSOR
Rep. Lawrence Lockman (R-Bradley)


# OFFICIAL TITLE
“An Act To Ensure the Right To Work without Payment of Dues or Fees to a Labor Union as a Condition of Employment”


# FINAL OUTCOME
Defeated


# SHORT DESCRIPTION
So called “right-to-work” laws are designed to weaken unions, drive down wages and allow workers to get the benefits of unions without paying dues. Currently in Maine in the private sector, unions and employers can negotiate contracts where all workers who benefit from a collective bargaining agree- ment share in the costs of bargaining and representation. LD 1232 would have made it illegal for employers and employees to agree that all workers who benefit from a collective bargaining agreement share in the costs.

President Troy Jackson (D-Aroostook)


# OFFICIAL TITLE
“An Act To Authorize Project Labor Agreements for Public Works Projects”


# FINAL OUTCOME
Enacted into law (Passed by the Legislature, Signed by the Governor)


# SHORT DESCRIPTION
This law would explicitly permit local governments and state agencies to require project labor agreements (PLAs) for public works projects if they are in the public’s interest. A PLA is a pre-hire, project wide negotiated agreement that establishes wages and work rules for all contractors and construction workers on a project. This business model is typically used for more complex, time sensitive projects to ensure they are done on time and on budget with the highest quality of work that pays living wages with benefits.

“An Act To Allow Public Employers of Teachers to Negotiate Regarding Educational Policies”


# FINAL OUTCOME

# SHORT DESCRIPTION
Under current law, teachers are prohibited from negotiating anything related to “educational policy.” This means that teachers cannot legally bargain over critical issues such as planning and preparation periods, teacher transfers and workload. LD 240 would have modified the law by giving teachers the right to negotiate over planning and preparation time.

# OFFICIAL TITLE
“An Act Regarding Utility Reorganizations”


# FINAL OUTCOME
Enacted into law (Passed the Legislature, Signed by the Governor)


# SHORT DESCRIPTION
When Verizon sold its landline assets to Fairpoint Communications in 2008, many critics expressed concern that such a small, undercapitalized company was not equipped to deliver quality service to its customers. The company went through bankruptcy, disrupted service and provoked a 131 day strike of its longtime employees. If there was a better standard for approving such sales, perhaps Maine could have gotten a better deal.
LD 1560 will strengthen that standard for approving approving utility reorganizations by requiring that these purchases meet a “net benefit” standard by showing that the benefits outweigh the costs and ratepayers should see a positive benefit.

Under the new law, these workers will accrue one hour of time off for every 40 hours worked after working for the same employer for 120 days.

# SHORT DESCRIPTION
As of 2013, the poverty rate for African Americans in Maine was over 50%, which was the highest in the nation, while one third of indigenous Mainers lived in poverty. Up until this year, the state has never attempted to understand why these alarming racial and ethnic disparities exist. LD 777 will establish the Permanent Commission on the Status of Racial, Indigenous and Maine Tribal Populations to examine how state policies affect economic disparities in communities of color and then advocate for policies that address the root causes of the problem.

# FINAL OUTCOME
Passed (Passed the Legislature, Signed by the Governor)


# SHORT DESCRIPTION
Employers commit wage theft by refusing to pay the minimum wage and overtime, misclassifying workers, not providing pay on time or forcing people to work off the clock. Unfortunately, the Maine Department of Labor has only five staff to investigate and enforce wage and hour laws covering more than 600,000 workers and more than 50,000 businesses. LD 1524 would protect workers from wage theft by providing them with stronger legal remedies.
